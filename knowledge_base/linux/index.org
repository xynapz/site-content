* The Repository
Welcome to my collection of Linux documentation. This section of the site serves as a digital garden for my explorations into open-source operating systems. Here you will find deep dives into the art of shell scripting, system administration, and reproducible environments. For low-level internals, see the [[../systems/index.org][Systems]] section.

* Series: From Chaos to Config
/Mastering Bash to Tame Arch/
** The Mission
To demystify the Linux boot process and userspace environment by building it from scratch, programmatically is the goal of this learning journey of mine. These posts moves beyond "copy-pasting commands" into the shell, to understanding the *why* behind the *what*, culminating in a custom bash script that turns a fresh Arch ISO into a fully configured Hyprland workstation from my dotfiles.
** The Roadmap

*** [[./chaos-to-config/00-manifesto.org][Part 0: The Manifesto]]
/Why manual installation is a trap and Bash is the universal glue./
- The philosophy of "Infrastructure as Code" for personal desktops.
- Setting up the project structure.
- Prerequisites and tooling.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/01-silicon-to-systemd.org][Part 1: From Silicon to Systemd]]
/What actually happens when you press the power button?/
- *Theory:* [[../systems/index.org][UEFI, Bootloaders]], [[../systems/linux-kernel/index.org][Kernel hand-off]], and PID 1.
- *Script:* Building the safety checks (UEFI detection, Root privileges, Logging).

*** [[./chaos-to-config/02-architect-and-mason.org][Part 2: The Architect & The Mason]]
/Mastering Package Management./
- *Theory:* Pacman, ALPM, and the risks/rewards of the AUR.
- *Script:* Automating the compilation of AUR helpers (Paru/Yay) and dependency arrays.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/03-graphics-stack.org][Part 3: The Graphics Stack]]
/Putting pixels on the screen./
- *Theory:* [[../systems/linux-kernel/index.org][Kernel Mode Setting (KMS), DRM]], and the X11 vs. Wayland architecture.
- *Script:* GPU hardware detection (`lspci`) and conditional driver installation (Nvidia/AMD).

*** [[./chaos-to-config/04-hyprland-engine.org][Part 4: The Engine (Hyprland)]]
/Compositors and Protocols./
- *Theory:* The Compositor as the Display Server (`wlroots`) and XDG Portals.
- *Script:* Installing the core desktop environment and session variables.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/05-ecosystem.org][Part 5: The Ecosystem]]
/The components that make a desktop usable./
- *Theory:* Pipewire (Audio), Waybar (Status), and Polkit (Auth).
- *Script:* Looping through component installation and font management.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/06-dotfiles-stow.org][Part 6: Controlled Chaos (Dotfiles)]]
/Configuration Management./
- *Theory:* XDG Base Directories and the Symlink philosophy.
- *Script:* Implementing `GNU Stow` logic and backup strategies within Bash.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/07-final-boot.org][Part 7: The Final Boot]]
/Optimization, Login, and Maintenance./
- *Theory:* Display Managers (SDDM) and [[../systems/index.org][TTYs]].
- *Script:* Service activation (`systemctl`), shell setup, and the final reboot hook.

*** [[./chaos-to-config/08-retrospective.org][Part 8: Review & Retrospective]]
/Lessons learned from the build./
- Full code repository.
- Future-proofing the script against rolling releases.

* Standalone Articles
/Independent explorations and technical notes./

** [[../../../setting-up-org-mode-pdf-export-on-arch-linux.org][Configuring Emacs Org mode for LaTeX and PDF export on Arch Linux]]
/A detailed walkthrough of configuring Emacs Org mode for LaTeX and PDF export on Arch Linux, including all the debugging steps, package installations, and configuration changes needed to make it work./
