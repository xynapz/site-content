* Core Modules
I categorize my C notes into specific domains of complexity, some contents are shared with C++ Notes, appropriate links and footnotes are available as well.

1. [[./memory/index.org][Memory Management]]: ~malloc~ and ~free~. Betond That And Custom allocators, alignment, and cache locality.
2. [[../../cpp/ds/index.org][Data Structures]]: Implementation of ring buffers, hash maps, and invasive lists.
