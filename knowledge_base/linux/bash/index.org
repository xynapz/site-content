* Bash Documentation
** Analysys and Findings
*** Variable Quoting When Referencing
Always quote variables within ~"${VAR}"~ double-quotes, to avoid unnecessary shell-expansion that bash does in the background. See an example of this issue in looping over an array section in [[file:arrays.org::#while-loop-iter][Iterating an array using while loop]](see the code #scenario-2)in the code block.

*** Arrays decays to first element, when provided without an index.

:END:
The array in bash I, think is kinda similar to arrays in the *c programming language* as in c when we pass an array to a function, it decays to the pointer to the first element in the array. In bash it is kind-of similar, as this decay happend everywhere in bash not just when passing to functions. Example, when I refer to an array without providing an index, the array variable decays down to the first element of the array in just the place it was refered.
