* Hashtable implementation using seperate chaining.
** Current Goal
- Implement a working hashtable.
- Roughly implement 80% of std::unordered_map

** Hashtable layout
[[kb_cpp:data-structures/hash_table.png]]
*** Node
The *Node* data structure will hold the key, value and link to the next node.
#+begin_src cpp
template <typename T>
struct Node{
  T key;
  T val;
  Node* next;
};
#+end_src
*** capacity_
- Variable for total hash table capacity.
#+begin_src cpp
const size_t kInitialHashCapacity{16};
size_t capacity_[kInitialHashCapacity];
#+end_src
- I will start will the initial capacity of 16 buckets for the hash table.
*** size_
- Variable for *storing* hashtable's current size.
#+begin_src cpp
size_t size_;
#+end_src
*** table_
- The table is of type pointer to a pointer to a *Node*.
#+begin_src cpp
Node** table_;
#+END_SRC
- *table_* is a pointer that points to first item of an array which hold object of type *Node**
- In case of collision, a nodes are chained in each array index.

*** Functionality
 - Find or Insert using overload *subscript* operator *[]*
    #+begin_src cpp
    phone_dir["Angel"] = "000-000-0000";
    std::string result = phone_dir["Angel"];
    #+end_src
 - Initially using just a Remove function but I am planning to implement a iterator style removal.
    #+begin_src cpp
    phone_dir.Remove("Angel");
    #+end_src
*** Resize Strategy
I am starting with an initial capacity and when the limit is hit, capacity is doubled, all the items are rehashed and moved to the new table.
*** Allocation and Deallocation Strategy
*Allocation*: The memory for the table with a capacity with be allocated during object construction, its, all the buckets in the table will be holding a empty linked list whose node will store *nullptr*.

*Deallocation*: The memory for the hashtable will be deallocated by iterating through the table and going through each node in a bucket and delete every node, and delete the table itself.
*** Hash Function
- A simple prime multiplication with mod division based hash function.
** LinkedList layout.
- Head Node that points to start of linked list.
- Size to store the number of items in the linked list.
- Other major operations like Insert, Remove, Search.
*** Node
- Key string type.
- Value string type.
- Link to next *Node*.
