* Introduction
In engineering, a **function** is the fundamental tool used to model relationships between physical quantities. Whether calculating stress vs. strain or voltage vs. time, functions map an input to a specific output.

** Definition
Formally, a function \( f \) from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y \) is a rule that assigns to each element \( x \in X \) exactly one element \( y \in Y \).

We write this as:
\[ y = f(x) \]

- **Independent Variable:** \( x \) (the input)
- **Dependent Variable:** \( y \) (the output)

"A function is like a machine: you put raw material (input) in, and you get a finished product (output) out."

* Core Concepts

** Domain and Range
Understanding the limitations of a system is crucial in engineering.
- **Domain:** The set of all possible input values (\(x\)) for which the function is defined.
- **Range:** The set of all possible output values (\(y\)).

*** Common Domain Restrictions
1. **Division by Zero:** In \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), \( x \neq 0 \).
2. **Even Roots of Negatives:** In \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \), \( x \ge 0 \) (in the real number system).
3. **Logarithms:** In \( f(x) = \ln(x) \), \( x > 0 \).

** The Vertical Line Test
A graph represents a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point.
- *Example:* A circle \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) is **not** a function (fails the test).
- *Example:* A parabola \( y = x^2 \) **is** a function.

* Classification of Functions
Functions in engineering are generally categorized as follows:

| Category | Type | Example | Engineering Application |
|----------|------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Algebraic** | Linear | \( f(x) = mx + b \) | Ohm's Law (\(V=IR\)) |
| | Quadratic | \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) | Projectile Motion |
| | Polynomial | \( f(x) = a_n x^n + \dots \) | Structural beam deflection |
| | Rational | \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) | Control systems (Transfer functions) |
| **Transcendental** | Exponential | \( f(x) = e^x \) | Capacitor charging/discharging |
| | Logarithmic | \( f(x) = \ln(x) \) | Signal processing (Decibels) |
| | Trigonometric | \( f(x) = \sin(x) \) | AC Circuits, Vibrations |

* Function Operations

** Composition of Functions
Composite functions model systems where the output of one process becomes the input of another.
Given \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \]

** Inverse Functions
The inverse function, denoted \( f^{-1}(x) \), reverses the operation of \( f \).
- *Condition:* A function must be **one-to-one** (passes the Horizontal Line Test) to have an inverse.
- *Relationship:* \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).

* Graphical Visualization
Visualizing functions is essential for understanding behavior. Below is a Python script embedded in this note to generate a plot of basic functions.

* Concept Diagram: The Black Box
Since we cannot render complex diagrams in plain text, we often use text-based representations or link to resources.

* Practice Problems
1. Determine the domain of \( f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2} \).
2. Find the inverse of \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \).
3. If \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x + 1 \), find \( f(g(x)) \).
