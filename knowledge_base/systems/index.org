* Introduction
This note covers my learning and research of systems and computing. While the root-level [[file:../linux/index.org][Linux]] section focuses on user-space utilities, administration, and customization, this *Systems* category dives into how the machine actually works all the way from the hardware initialization level.

* Languages
** [[file:c/index.org][C Programming]]
The lingua franca of systems programming.

* Kernel Internals
** [[./linux-kernel/index.org][Linux Kernel]]
** [[./operating-systems-three-easy-pieces.org][Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (Notes)]]
