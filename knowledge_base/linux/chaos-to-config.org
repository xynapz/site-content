* Series: From Chaos to Config
/Mastering Bash to Tame Arch/
** The Roadmap

*** Part 0: The Manifesto
/Why manual installation is a trap and Bash is the universal glue./
- The philosophy of "Infrastructure as Code" for personal desktops.
- Setting up the project structure.
- Prerequisites and tooling.

*** Part 1: From Silicon to Systemd
/What actually happens when you press the power button?/
- *Theory:* [[../systems/index.org][UEFI, Bootloaders]], [[../systems/linux-kernel/index.org][Kernel hand-off]], and PID 1.
- *Script:* Building the safety checks (UEFI detection, Root privileges, Logging).

*** Part 2: The Architect & The Mason
/Mastering Package Management./
- *Theory:* Pacman, ALPM, and the risks/rewards of the AUR.
- *Script:* Automating the compilation of AUR helpers (Paru/Yay) and dependency arrays.

*** Part 3: The Graphics Stack
/Putting pixels on the screen./
- *Theory:* Kernel Mode Setting (KMS), DRM, and the X11 vs. Wayland architecture.
- *Script:* GPU hardware detection (`lspci`) and conditional driver installation (Nvidia/AMD).

*** Part 4: The Engine (Hyprland)
/Compositors and Protocols./
- *Theory:* The Compositor as the Display Server (`wlroots`) and XDG Portals.
- *Script:* Installing the core desktop environment and session variables.

*** Part 5: The Ecosystem
/The components that make a desktop usable./
- *Theory:* Pipewire (Audio), Waybar (Status), and Polkit (Auth).
- *Script:* Looping through component installation and font management.

*** Part 6: Controlled Chaos (Dotfiles)
/Configuration Management./
- *Theory:* XDG Base Directories and the Symlink philosophy.
- *Script:* Implementing `GNU Stow` logic and backup strategies within Bash.

*** Part 7: The Final Boot
/Optimization, Login, and Maintenance./
- *Theory:* Display Managers (SDDM) and TTYs.
- *Script:* Service activation (`systemctl`), shell setup, and the final reboot hook.

*** Part 8: Review & Retrospective
/Lessons learned from the build./
- Full code repository.
- Future-proofing the script against rolling releases.
