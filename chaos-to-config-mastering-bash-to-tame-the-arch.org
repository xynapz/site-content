* Taming the Arch
It started with a simple thought: 'I should automate this.' I had just finished my third Arch Linux installation of the month—don't ask—and the thrill of typing `pacstrap` had long worn off. I looked at my scattered config files, my mental checklist of packages, and my growing disdain for manual repetition. I decided it was time to write The Script. You know the one. The script that takes a fresh, barren TTY and turns it into *my* computer with a single command. How hard could it be? It's just Bash, right?

* The Dream: One Command to Rule Them All
* The Reality: Dependency Hell and Race Conditions
* The Tool: Why Bash? (And Why I Regret It... Sort of)
* The Architecture: Breaking Down the Monolith
* The Result: A Reproducible Haven
