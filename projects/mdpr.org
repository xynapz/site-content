* mdpr - Multi-line Markdown Parser
mdpr is a command-line tool written in C that parses multi-line code blocks within a markdown file and extracts only the relevant code content. This is particularly useful for extracting code snippets from large markdown files containing documentation or tutorials.
** Features
- Parses multi-line code blocks delimited by opening (/*) and closing (*/) comments.
- Ignores leading and trailing whitespace within the block.
- Trims leading and trailing spaces from each line of code within the block.
- Outputs the extracted code content to a specified output file.
** Usage
*Build*: mdpr requires a C compiler and standard libraries to build. Run the following command in your terminal:

#+begin_src bash
gcc -o mdpr main.c
#+end_src

*Run:*
mdpr takes two arguments:
- -f: Path to the input markdown file containing the code blocks.
- -o: Path to the output file where the extracted code will be written.
*Example:*
 #+begin_src bash
./mdpr -f test_file.c -o test_file.md
 #+end_src
Running this command will parse the test_file.c file for multi-line code blocks and write the extracted code to test_file.md.

** Limitation
- This current version only supports code blocks delimited by comment characters (/* and */).
- Nested code blocks are not supported.
