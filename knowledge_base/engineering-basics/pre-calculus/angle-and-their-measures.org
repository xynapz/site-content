* Angle and their measures

** Rays
A ray is a line that has a fixed starting point but doesn't have a fixed endpoint, rays have one fixed endpoint and extend to infinity. So, the measurement of a ray is not possible.

** Vertex and Angles
When two rays share the same endpoint, they form an angle, that shared endpoint is called a vertex. A vertex is a point shared by the initial ray and the terminal ray of an angle. Another, a vertex is a common endpoint of two rays that form an angle.

When the initial ray and the terminal ray are directly opposite to each other, they form a straight angle.

#+begin_quote
One complete revolution as shown below is 360 Degrees, and parts of a revolution are measured proportionately. Thus half of a revolution (a straight angle) measures 180 Degrees, a quarter of a revolution (a right angle) measures 90 Degrees and so on.

#+begin_quote
if an angle measures strictly between 0 Degrees and 90 Degrees, it is called an acute angle and if it measures strictly between 90 Degrees and 180 Degrees it is called an obtuse angle.
