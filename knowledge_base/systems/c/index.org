* Context
C is not just a language; it is the portable assembly of the modern world. Despite the rise of Rust and Zig, C remains the *lingua franca* of systems interfaces (ABIs).

To understand C is to understand the machine. It forces you to think about:
- Stack frames and calling conventions.
- The virtual memory map.
- The cost of abstraction.

* Core Modules
I categorize my C notes into specific domains of complexity:

1. [[./memory/index.org][Memory Management]]: Beyond ~malloc~ and ~free~. Custom allocators, alignment, and cache locality.
2. [[../../cpp/ds/index.org][Data Structures]]: Implementation of ring buffers, hash maps, and invasive lists.
3. *Concurrency*: Pthreads, atomics, and memory ordering (WIP).
