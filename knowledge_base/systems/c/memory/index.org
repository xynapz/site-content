* The Illusion of the Heap
We often treat memory as an infinite tape provided by ~malloc()~. In reality, the heap is a complex negotiation between the C runtime (libc) and the kernel.

When we request memory, we are usually interacting with a general-purpose allocator (dlmalloc, jemalloc, mimalloc). However, for high-performance systems (like game engines or high-frequency trading), general-purpose allocators are bottlenecks due to:

1. *Lock Contention*: Thread safety overhead.
2. *Fragmentation*: Holes in the heap causing poor cache locality.
3. *Header Overhead*: Metadata storage for every allocation.
